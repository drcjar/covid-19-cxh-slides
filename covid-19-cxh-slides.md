# Caveat emptor

#

This is written by respiratory doctors for an audience that includes medical students in the midst of a pandemic; it's a fluid situation, lots of research is being done and information contained within may become stale quickly. If you spot a bug or inaccuracy please ping me at [drcjar@gmail.com](drcjar@gmail.com) or submit a pull request [https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/](https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/) and I will fix.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
- describe the basic epidemiology of COVID-19
- summarise the key clinical features of COVID-19
- describe initial management of the disease, including of infection control procedures
- assess disease severity and judge chances of a successful outcome with intensive care

# sars-cov2 and covid-19

#

- Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the bug; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the pneumonia that the bug causes

#

- SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus (approximately 120 nm in diameter) from a family of viruses called coronaviruses. Corona means crown; it's called coronavirus because the virus is spherical and has spikes which look like a crown when viewed down an electron microscope.

# basic epidemiology of covid-19

#

-  WHO informed of outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019; declared public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020; declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020

#

- R0, the basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
- it's 2-3 for COVID-19 hence preventing spread is v important

# 

- incubation period thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure

#

- COVID-19 is increasingly common in the UK population just now; for most people it's a mild self-limiting disease characterised by cough and fever secondary to respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, a small subset of of people with disease need hospital admission and a small subset of those need ITU.

#
- demand for hospital admission and ITU will shortly outstrip supply; [case fatality rate is probably around 1%](https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) (country figures depend on case definition and how much testing is done; note also infection fatality rate is lower since some people are infected but never become symptomatic and so never become a case). 

# 

- no significant sex difference, risk factors for disease include include having contact with a confirmed case, risk factors for more severe disease include being older, having comorbidities such as pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and smoking.

#

- droplet (dominant means of transmission, can't travel more than 1m, can persist on surfaces, surgical mask helpful)
- aerosol transmission (can travel more than 1m, surgical mask not helpful)
- social distancing, hand hygiene, and in a hosp setting appropriate use of PPE are important.

#

- be aware of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) including intubation, extubation and related procedures, tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures, manual ventilation, open suctioning, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP), surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used, high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV), high-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO), induction of sputum, some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).

- wear appropriate PPE if you are exposed to AGP (at time of writing this is FFP3 as a minimum); make sure you learn to [doff and don PPE safely (having a buddy helps)](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/ppe/ppe-sequence.pdf)

# 

- don't take COVID-19 home; change your scrubs or clothes ideally before leaving work, but
certainly on arriving home, and wash clothes just as you normally would (virus disolved by normal detergent on a normal wash)

# key clinical features of covid-19

#

- it's a chameleon (can present in lot of different ways, can hide in plain view)

#

- typical presentation is cough and fever
- other features include breathlessness, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia
- less often chest pain (2-5%), GI (D&V 1-10%, abdo pain approx 2%) and neurological symptoms e.g headache confusion (9%), dizziness (9-12%)

#

- differential diagnosis broad; plenty of diseases can mimic including flu, disease can also co-exist
- no reason to think usual population diseases are going to go away so Hickam's dictum likely to apply: "A man can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases."

#

- investigations to confirm diagnosis (and rule out differentials) and grade severity
- basics include SpO2 (+/- abg), fbc (lymphopenia common), U&Es, lfts, crp, d-dimer (high d-dimer assoc with increased mortality), CXR (bilateral infiltrates), nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and sputum for micro (there's a molecular test), serological test soon
- even with 'gold standard' testing (multiple micro samples) and CT chest sensitivity and specificity only around 90% i.e false-negative and false-positive results are seen.

#

- management is largely supportive (several ongoing drug trials and vaccine development efforts; no drugs proven safe and effective yet) and prognosis good for most people infected (naturally much less good for subset of patients unwell enough for hospital admission)

#

- important to consider non-COVID-19 disease

#

- important to isolate patient and take appropriate respiratory precautions

#

- important to consider, and discuss with patients and document ceilings of care; clinical frailty score can be helpful in assessing who is likely to benefit from critical care.

#

- important to be careful with fluids (no role unless pt is shocked, might make oxygenation worse), steroids (no role, likely to increase mortality), no role for routine antipyretic administration to treat fever

#

- important to escalate early (if pt is for escalation) and requiring increase respiratory support and/or multiple organ support

#

- important to use appropriate PPE (we can't look after our patients if don't look after ourselves), to not be at work if you, or someone in your household, shows symptoms (follow PHE and local guidelines). important to check if you should be at work or not if you're pregnant, have a pre-existing medical condition, or take immunosuppressants.

# Useful contacts

#

- COVID team, ITU, Palliative care, Site manager, Bed manager, Psych liason, Infection protection control
- induction is app usually good

# nota bene

#

- it's a pandemic; demand will outstrip supply, we all need to pull together to do the best we can for our patients with the limited resource we have, we will all have important parts to play, no task that helps our patients is too small (and none of us are too big for any task that helps our patients)
